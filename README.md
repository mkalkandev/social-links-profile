# Challenge

My app allows users to:

Display the optimal layout for the app based on their device's screen size
See the navigation states for all interactive elements on the page
Ongoing development
This was my third project involving HTML and CSS and I am happy with the result. This time I tried to learn new things so I tried to structure HTML better and used flex and pseudo-classes in CSS. I also did a small introduction to Responsive design.

I plan to continue exploring this technology and learning more, so there will definitely be more projects related to this soon.
